# Pedestrian movement prediction using Cellular Automata

Detection and analysis of pedestrian movement is of increasing interest in the field of image processing. 
Predicting the trajectory of their movement is a task with many real-world applications, such as autonomous driving systems and robot trajectory planning, among others. 

In addition to the obvious parameters necessary for prediction, such as speed or direction of movement, it is also necessary to take into account the psychological factor affecting the behavior of pedestrians to properly analyze the problem. 
Cultural principles, biological boundaries, social norms and the infrastructure of the area undoubtedly influence pedestrian decision-making. 

Understanding the many socially acceptable possible behaviors is an important aspect for realizing the problem of pedestrian traffic prediction. 
In order for this possibility to exist, new solutions are being developed that bring significant improvements to previous approaches. 
Despite significant advances, it is still a challenge for existing approaches to capture the uncertainty and multimodality of human navigation decision-making.
